# Facebook-Mobile---Hide-suggested-posts
Hide reels, follow/join suggestions, and suggested friends from Facebook mobile

** Very heavily inspired by the great work of @webdevs-sk (https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/479868-fb-mobile-clean-my-feeds)

Since the original script is at "End of Life", I made my own version with much help from https://claude.ai, and it works so well that I thought I'd share it here. Very light, very fast.

It hides Reels/Sponsored/Join/Follow posts, and 'People you may know'. All are hidden by default, but if you wish to permanently enable some, there are variables that you can change in the Filter Settings at the top of the script. Just change the text 'true' to 'false' and reopen Facebook in a new tab. I also added an option to 'tap to show' the hidden posts, in case you feel curious about what content was hidden.

** This has only been tested in Cromite browser on Android. Not sure about compatibility with other browsers.

Enjoy :)
